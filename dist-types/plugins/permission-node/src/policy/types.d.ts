 * resources, such a catalog entities, a conditional response can also be returned. This states
 * that the action is allowed if the conditions provided hold true.
 *
 * Conditions are a rule, and parameters to evaluate against that rule. For example, the rule might
 * be `isOwner` and the parameters a collection of entityRefs; if one of the entityRefs matches
 * the `owner` field on a catalog entity, this would resolve to ALLOW.
