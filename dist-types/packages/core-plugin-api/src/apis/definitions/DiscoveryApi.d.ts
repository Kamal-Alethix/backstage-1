 *
 * The purpose of the discovery API is to allow for many different deployment
 * setups and routing methods through a central configuration, instead
 * of letting each individual plugin manage that configuration.
 *
 * Implementations of the discovery API can be a simple as a URL pattern
 * using the pluginId, but could also have overrides for individual plugins,
 * or query a separate discovery service.
